## Unageo typeface

Unageo is a simple, geometric typeface with variable weight and italic angle support, that was made with digital use in mind, however it works in print just as well .

It's designed to use perfect geometric shapes where possible while still maintaining great readability and it uses almost uniform stroke width all across each glyph on all weights.

Other than latin, Unageo also supports cyrillic and greek scripts.
Unageo cyrillic was made in bulgarian style, that uses more rounded shapes and differentiated letter heights which makes it easier to tell letters apart and further improves readability.
Greek uses the same rounded shapes and adds smooth lines to give it a more unique style.

### How was it made?
Unageo is my first attempt at making a font, and since I had almost no prior experience with font creation and limited software avalability, I worked on Unageo with an unusual workflow. I designed the characters in inkscape and imported the outlines into fontforge. Since I'm familiar with inkscape, designing the glyphs  wasn't too hard and inkscape has great tools for working with perfect geometry. It wasn't as great with fontforge, but I got accustomed to it quite fine and I was able to finish my font. After it was done, I used fontmake to generate my variable fonts and then fonttools mutator to generate the static fonts. Static fonts can also be exported directly from fontforge as the sources are interpolable.
